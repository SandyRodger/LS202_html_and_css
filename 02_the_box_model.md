## [Introduction](https://launchschool.com/lessons/f039db62/assignments/70151955)

- In this lesson we will look at:
  - Different types of display objects
  - Dimensions / spacing
  - The box model
- Testing and Validation: In the last lesson LS nudged us to do this. Now we have to build up the habit for ourselves.
- The following steps should become 2nd nature:
  - Update your code
  - Test the results ion the browser
  - Validate your HTML
  - Validate your CSS
  - Check your work on other browsers (don't wait till the end of your project for this)
  - Repeat

### What to focus on

- The CSS box model, which browsers use to construct a web-page. 
  - It's a crucial concept.
  - Go through this lesson multiple times.
  - Learn what to expect from your browser when it processes your html/css, and how that depends on:
    - The visual display model
    - box-sizing model
    - box properties

#### Vocabulary

- The box model
  - box properties
    - width and height
    - padding and margins
    - borders
  - visual display models
    - `block`
    - `inline`
    - `inline-block`
  - Box sizing model
    - `content-box`
    - `border box`
  - Dimensions
    - absolute units
    - relative units
- Also
  - container
  - physical pixels
  - CSS reference pixels

#### Box Properties

- Every box has
  - width
  - height
  - padding
  - margins
  - border
- Padding, margins, border have top, bottom, left, right
- How does the visual display model interact with margins borders and padding?

#### Visual Display Models

- Understand the difference between `inline`, `block` and `inline-block`.
- Containers are almost always block elements, non-containers are almost always `inline`. When in doubt check MDN.
- Don't try to memorize which elements are block or inline.
- How/when do you change an element's visual display model.

#### Box Sizing Models

- Understand the `content-box` and `border-box` sizing models.
- How and when can you change the box-sizing model for an element?

#### Dimensions

- Know the difference between `px`, `rem`, `em`, `%` and `auto`.
- Underdstand physical pixels v CSS reference pixels.
- Use `auto` margins to center block elements horizontally.

#### HTML

- Don;t try and memorize the new HTML elements.

#### CSS

- Become comfortable with and memorize the following CSS properties:
  - `border`
  - `display`
  - `box-sizing`
  - `width`
  - `height`
  - `padding`
  - `margin`

#### Try the examples

- Don't just copy and paste the examples.
- After you're done, play around, try and break them, see what happens.

#### Using documentation

- This lesson will have new CSS/HTML which won't be explained - you have to look it up.
- For example, you might have to change the appearance of a list.

#### Study from the Summary

- This is a list of things you should have mastered by the end of the course.
