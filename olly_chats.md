What I've been up to:

- Refactor calorie counter
  - add year overview
  - appreciate the necessity of testing now + comments
- Everything is a box
- Sentencing - references
- Last coding meeting until 4th July
- Bumped into ex-colleague who did the [Harvard online courses - CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/subject/programming) in 7 months intensive.
- LS202 might be the hardest course just because it's so boring and finicky. (It is, in fact, optional, I'm on lesson 2/8). How did you do it? What was your note-taking like?

Questions:

- this bug: zsh, my path in calorie counter

What we talked about:

- the `.bashrc` file as a place to automate my bug-fix.
- How the front end part of the course might not be necessary to complete entirely
- how I'm skipping LS202
- Olly showed me his projects from LS, but doesn't have his notes any more as they were on a since deleted app.
